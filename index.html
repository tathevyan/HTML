  <hr />
  <p>
    The Russian Tstnaya Bolonka is even-tempered, very intelligent, friendly to
    all, and should never be shy or show aggression in any way. The Russian
    Tszvetnaya Bolonka was specifically developed as a companion dog and is
    prized for its sociable, easy-going and affectionate temperament. Its
    specimens will avoid exuberant games and will not appreciate any extent of
    physical abuse during playing. The Russian Tsvetnaya Bolonka usually
    perceives all unfamiliar people as potential playmates and without timely
    socialization, it can grow into an inappropriate greeter. However, this
    breed was bred with strong tendency to defend its territory and its favorite
    humans, so it can become a fairly good watchdog. The Russian Tsvetnaya
    Bolonka will not be able to apply to necessary aggression when the situation
    calls for it, and should not be tasked with the responsibilities of a
    guardian.
